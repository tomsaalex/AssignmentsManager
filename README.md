# AssignmentsManager

A project I made in university for assigning, managing and grading homework for students.

## Features

Some of the features this application offers are:
 - A Command-Line Interface
 - Student management (the app lets you add, remove or update students' properties at any time)
 - Homework management (the app lets you add, remove or update homework problems, as well as assign them to laboratories, at any time)
 - Handing out assignments (the app lets you assign one or more problems to any students with no restrictions!)
 - Grading assignments (any assignments given to students can be graded at any point)
 - Generating a set of predefined statistics at any point for the current students and assignments
 - Filtering students by name, to make searching through them easier.

## Technologies

This project has been made exclusively using:
 - The Python programming language
 - The Colorama Python module (to make the CLI interface a bit easier to follow)
